# Packages required not in the Raspbian install

List of packages required to be enabled for the balloon system to operate:
- wiringPi ([site](http://wiringpi.com/),
  [install](http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/))

WiringPi allows very convenient use of SPI, UART, and GPIO within programs, and
includes examples using similar parts to what we are using.
