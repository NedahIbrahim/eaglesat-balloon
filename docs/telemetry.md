# Description of telemetry sensors for the balloon test

The sensors being flown on the balloon test are used to detect pressure and
temperature of the environment in-flight. The pressure sensor being used is a
Honeywell SSC analog pressure sensor with a 5V power supply. The analog output
voltage ranges from 10% to 90% the supply voltage. The temp sensor hasn't been
determined yet.

## Needs from OBC

The OBC is responsible for interfacing to all telemetry sensing hardware. It
will use an SPI ADC to interface to an analog pressure sensor (Honeywell SSC).
